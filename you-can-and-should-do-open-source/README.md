# You can and should do open source!

## Description

> In this talk, attendees will hear personal stories about open source involvement and a fun, heartfelt pitch for why they should consider getting more involved in open source projects they use. The talk is intended to inspire those who have never contributed, or who don't contribute much, and is not a hands-on tutorial describing exactly how to do things like make pull requests or write tests.
