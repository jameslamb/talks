## Description

> "In this talk, we’ll describe NoSQL (“not-only SQL”) and document-oriented databases and the value they provide for data science companies like Uptake. We will walk through the unique challenges such datastores pose for data science workflows. To make these challenges and lessons learned concrete, we’ll explore data science workflows through a discussion of the development efforts that led to [uptasticsearch](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/uptasticsearch/index.html), an R package released by the Uptake Data Science team to reduce friction in interacting with a document store called [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/UptakeOpenSource/uptasticsearch). The talk will conclude with a discussion of recent developments in NoSQL technologies and implications for data scientists."
