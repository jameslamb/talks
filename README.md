# talks

This repository holds information on talks I've given at conferences, meetups, and other venues like internal trainings at work.

Some directories contain source files used to create the talks, while others just include links to videos or files available for download.

If you attended one of these talks and have follow-up questions:

1. Thank you so much for attending!
2. Open [an issue](https://github.com/jameslamb/talks/issues) or email me at jaylamb20@gmail.com
