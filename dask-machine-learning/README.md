# Scaling Machine Learning With Python and Dask

## Description

> In this talk, attendees will get an introduction to Dask, a distributed computing framework in the PyData ecosystem. The first half of the talk will describe the current state of the project and its ecosystem including distributed data collections, cloud deployment options, distributed machine learning projects, and workflow orchestration. The second half of the talk will be a live demo showing the programming model for machine learning on Dask. Benchmarks with comparisons to single-node training (scikit-learn) and Spark (Spark ML) for tree-based supervised learning models will be presented.
