# People Shape Software: What I Learned Comparing Python And R Apis

## Description

> I’ve spent the last year working on major improvements to a large IIoT platform and on ongoing maintenance of a variety of open source projects. Through these activities, I’ve encountered the same problem many times: “we have/need Python and R packages that do the same thing”. In each of these applications, I found that different developers worked on the Python and R implementations and arrived at very different user interfaces. In my opinion this is a fascinating case study in the human side of software development: “how could two communities of developers given the same functional requirements arrive at such different APIs?” In this short talk, I’ll attempt to answer that and to offer some conjectures on what I think is at place. I’ll use evidence from several open source projects (XGBoost, LightGBM, uptasticsearch, Apache Arrow) using an open source project I’ve created called “doppel-cli” (https://github.com/jameslamb/doppel-cli). I will also explain why I think keeping the APIs for these libraries consistent across languages is beneficial to developers and users, and I’ll show how I use doppel-cli to do that on my own projects. Attendees will learn a bit about the social forces that lead to particular software implementations and how to think outside the box in using CI to control a project’s direction. They’ll also get introduced to some open source data science projects that could use more attention from the R community!
