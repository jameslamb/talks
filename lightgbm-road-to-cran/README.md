# LightGBM's Road to CRAN

## Description

If you’ve ever been mystified by the stream of compiler messages that show up when you run `install.packages()`, this talk might be for you!

This talk will highlight some sad, strange, and beautiful features of the R ecosystem that I’ve learned in the two years I’ve been working on getting LightGBM’s R package ready for CRAN. [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) is a machine learning library implemented in C++. The C++ library is shared by wrappers in several languages, including Java, Python, and R, and the talk will highlight the unique challenges that poses. Think of this talk as a short, dramatic interpretation of “Writing R Extensions” (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).
